## Story behind Thunder Client
I have my other project [localmint.com](https://www.localmint.com/), where I need to update the location data, which involves dealing with lot of crawlers & api, I was using Postman to test APIs from last few years, But recently for each update the Postman client is becoming slow and confusing UI, So I started looking for other clients, which I found has no easy UI and requires multiple clicks to make a simple api request. Then I searched the VS Code extension gallery and found REST Client extension which is popular but not a GUI based client. So I finally decided to create a GUI based extension which is easy to use and one click access to most functionality.

## Features
. Send http/https request to API using any of the methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD and OPTIONS.
